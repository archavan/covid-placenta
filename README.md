**Abstract**: Pregnant women with COVID-19 are at significantly increased risk for severe outcomes, but the pathophysiology underlying this increased morbidity remains incompletely understood. In this study of forty pregnant women with COVID-19, we assessed viral and immune dynamics at the placenta during maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find that, in uninfected women, ACE2 is highly expressed in syncytiotrophoblast cells of the placenta during early pregnancy but is rarely expressed in the placenta at full-term. In contrast, ACE2 is significantly overexpressed in the term placenta from women with COVID-19. Using immortalized cell lines and primary isolated placental cells, we demonstrate the vulnerability of various placental cell types to direct infection by SARS-CoV-2 *in vitro*. Yet, despite the susceptibility of placental cells to SARS-CoV-2 infection, we find that only a subset (13%) of women in this cohort had evidence for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the placenta. Through single cell transcriptomic analyses of placenta and decidua from maternal COVID-19 affected pregnancies compared to healthy controls we find evidence for a robust immune response at the placenta, including increased activation of placental NK and T cells and increased expression of interferon related genes. Overall, this study indicates that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with immune activation at the maternal-fetal interface even in the absence of local viral invasion. While this may represent a protective mechanism shielding the placenta from infection, inflammatory changes in the placenta may contribute to poor pregnancy outcomes and thus warrant further investigation.
